Notebook from the kaggle competition House Prices: advanced regression techniques

The data can be founf here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data

In this notebook I go through some data exploration, cleaning before testing different models.
I finish by blending the models to get the final prediction. 

I archived a score of 0.11760 that put me, at the time I write this in the top 16%.
